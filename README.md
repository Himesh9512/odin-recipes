About Project:


This is my first project of The odin project academy.

In this project i am going to build a recipe page.Recipe page will consist of index page with link of some recipes,I need to use basic Html to complete this project.

Recipe project will improve my basic understanding on web designing with Html and it will clear my fundamentals.

What i learned from this project:

- usage of html tags
- writing structured code
- using unordered and ordered lists
- adding images to web pages
- some guidance on version control with git and github
